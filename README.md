# NS4 SBE
Naruto Storm 4 - Story Battle Editor

Welcome. This is just being set up.

===================================================================
Actual version: v0.2

v0.2 Changelog:
- Added condition editor.
- Added preset ID manager.
- Each battle now displays the name of the character that the preset ID belongs to if you have a PIL (preset ID list) loaded in the tool.

Your preset id list must be in this format:
XX XX = CHARACTER 1 NAME
YY YY = CHARACTER 2 NAME
and so on. Make sure you only put one character per line, and the preset ID must be splitted in two (DD00 must be written as DD 00).

===================================================================
v0.1: First public release of NS4SBE.
